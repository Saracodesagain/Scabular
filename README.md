# Scabular
Scanning process relationships
**Scabular** Scabular was created while im aspriring to become a blue teamer. Scabular is a lightweight and local cybersecurity tool for analyzing Windows process lists and detecting unusual parent-child relationships. It's designed mainly for blue team learners, malware analysts, and SOC trainees who want to explore process anomalies, especially because windows is used by most companies and therefore its a target. 
This is not meant to be used by professionals though, as SOC tools already scan for unusal parent-child relationships.

## What It Does

Scabular parses process data from exports (from task manager) and flags suspicious or uncommon parent-child process combinations.

## Installation

TBD
